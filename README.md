# What I learned with this challenge

This project was a great challenge. At first sight, it may seem easy to
complete, but once you start coding you soon realize there are a lot of ways to
complete it, and choosing the right one can take a long time, lots of trials and
erros. It would definitely be easier if one had the right sizes for every
section, but I guess that's the poing of doing it like this, it pushes you to
think and find solutions to small problems. Overall a great project.
